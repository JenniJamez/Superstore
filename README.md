# Superstore
Context 
Retail dataset of a four-year worldwide superstore.
From the latest date of the training dataset, perform EDA and forecast sales for the following 7 days!
Time series analysis uses data that is based on time series to extract patterns for forecasts and other aspects of the data. It makes use of a model to predict future values over a short period of time using prior observations. It is frequently used for non-stationary data, including forecasting retail sales, stock prices, weather, and economic data.

To perform EDA on a dataset, you have to; 
•	Understand the variables in the dataset
•	Clean the data from redundancies
•	Analyze the relationship between variables
•	Explore and visualize relationships
•	Charts and plots such as Histograms, Scatterplots, PMFs and CMFs (to visualize distributions), Boxplots, and Line graphs are used for plotting in EDA.

Inspiration
Perform EDA and Predict the sales of the next 7 days from the last date of the Training dataset!
The purpose of the dataset is to have an insight into superstore sales. In this dataset, our target variable is "Sales".
•	What day of the week is our sales high on average?
•	What are monthly average sales?
•	What is the year-over-growth year/ total sales over the years?
•	Who is the top customer of all time?
•	What are the highest sales by category?
•	Which city does have the highest sales?

According to data visualization;
•	Sales are typically highest on Saturday and Thursday of the week.
•	2018 saw the most total sales, but 2017 saw the highest year-over-year growth.
•	Miller, who is in the home Office sector, is the most frequently used customer ever.
•	Technology has the most sales per category.
